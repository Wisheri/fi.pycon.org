        Keynote by Tuomas Suutari - Developing and Deploying Python
        Web Applications with Docker
    </a></h3>
<p>Docker is a new container technology for Linux that has recently become
quite popular.  It allows packaging applications as images that are easy
to create, share and deploy.  For you, as a Python developer, it is a
new tool for your toolbox that can make yours or your sysadmin's life a
lot easier.
</p>
<p>
The talk introduces you to the world of Docker and presents some
thoughts on why it is a good choice for deploying Python applications
and how it can help you in the development process.

        Ned Jackson Lovely - Enough Machine Learning to Make Hacker News
        Readable Again
    </a></h3>
<p>
It's inevitable that online communities will change, and that we'll remember
the community with a fondness that likely doesn't accurately reflect the
former reality. We'll explore how we can take a set of articles from an online
community and winnow out the stuff we feel is unworthy. We'll explore some of
the machine learning tools that are just a "pip install" away, such as
scikit-learn and nltk.

    <h3><a href="#talks-lusmu" class="pagelink">
        Antti Kaihola - Lusmu, a dataflow/reactive programming library for Python
        </a></h3>
<p>
On ships sailing all over the world, Eniram helps ship crews reduce ship
running costs and emissions by optimizing ship operations. Hundreds of
measurements are constantly collected on each ship. Our data processing
systems are being replaced with a unified Python-based framework. At the heart
of it is Lusmu, a small yet powerful reactive programming library.
</p>
<p>
In the reactive programming model used by Lusmu, data is fed into inputs of a
directed graph. Calculations are done by nodes of the graph lazily only when
resulting data is being accessed.
</p>
<p>
This talk illustrates how Lusmu works by walking through a simplified
implementation in source code. Usage scenarios for developers and end users
are presented using real-world examples.
</p>
<p>
<b>About the author:</b> Antti Kaihola is a Python developer with a 15-year
friendship with the language and a more recent background in web backend
development. He's currently working as a Senior Research Engineer at Eniram
Ltd in Helsinki.

    <h3><a href="#talks-rope-traad" class="pagelink">
        Austin Bingham - Python Refactoring with Rope and Traad
    </a></h3>
<p>
Python is a modern, dynamic language which is growing in popularity, but tool
support for it is sometime lacking or only available in specific environments.
For refactoring and other common IDE functions, however, the powerful
open-source rope library provides a set of tools which are designed to be
integrated into almost any programming environment. Rope supports most common
refactorings, such as renaming and method extraction, but also more
Python-specific refactorings, such as import organization. Rope’s underlying
code analysis engine also allows it to do things like locating method
definitions and generating auto-completion suggestions.
</p>
<p>
While rope is designed to be used from many environments, it’s not always easy
or ideal to integrate rope directly into other programs. Traad  (Norwegian for
“thread”) is another open-source project that addresses this problem by
wrapping rope into a simple client-server model so that client programs (IDEs,
editors, etc.) can perform refactorings without needing to embed rope
directly. This simplifies dependencies, makes clients more robust in the face
of errors, eases traad client development, and even allows clients to do
things like switch between Python 2 and 3 refactoring in the same session.
</p><p>
In this session we’ll look at how rope operates, and we’ll see how traad wraps
it to provide an easier integration interface. The audience will get enough
information to start using rope themselves, either directly or via traad, and
they’ll see how to use traad for integrating rope into their own environments.
More generally, we’ll look at why client-server refactoring tools might be
preferable to the more standard approach of direct embedding.

    <h3><a href="#talks-extending-python" class="pagelink">
        Francisco Fernández - Extending Python, What Is the Best
        Option for Me?
    </a></h3>
<p>
Python is a great language, but there are occasions where we need access to
low level operations or connect with some database driver written in C. With
the FFI(Foreign function interface) we can connect Python with other languages
like C, C++ and even the new Rust. There are some alternatives to achieve this
goal, Native Extensions, Ctypes and CFFI. I'll compare this three ways of
extending Python.
</p>
<p>
    <b>About the author:</b> Francisco Fernandez works as a software engineer at
    biicode in Madrid. He uses Python as his main programming language but he
    also program in other languages like Scala, Go, Clojure... His main
    interests are distributed systems, functional programming and graph
    databases.

    <h3><a href="#talks-iterators-generators" class="pagelink">
        Andrew Dalke - Iterators, Generators, and Coroutines
    </a></h3>
<p>
Python 2 introduced the iterator protocol, which has since become an essential
language concept. Generators - functions with a yield - make it much easier to
write an iterator. What's less commonly known is that generators have evolved
to be usable co-routines. These are the basis for the new asyncio module in
Python 3.3, though I won't talk about asyncio.
</p><p>
My presentation will structure the concepts around file I/O. I'll develop
various iterators to read records from a file, and then show how to 'reverse'
a generator to make a coroutine to write records to a file.
</p>

        Jouni Seppänen - Plotting with Matplotlib
    </a></h3>
<p>
Matplotlib is the most popular plotting library for Python, but getting
started may be daunting for non-experts, especially if you want to format your
plots differently from the default. I will show by example how to create plots
and figure out from the Python prompt how to change the various details.

    <h3><a href="#talks-dh-virtualenv" class="pagelink">
    Jyrki Pulliainen - Packaging in packaging: dh-virtualenv
    </a></h3>

<p>
Deploying your software can become a tricky task, regardless of the language.
In the spirit of the Python conferences, every conference needs at least one
packaging talk.

This talk is about dh-virtualenv. It's a Python packaging tool aimed for
Debian-based systems and for deployment flows that already take advantage of
Debian packaging with Python virtualenv.
</p>
<p>
Dh-virtualenv is an open source tool developed at Spotify. We use it to ease
deploying our Python software to production. We built dh-virtualenv as a tool
that fits our existing continuous integration flow with a dedicated sbuild
server. As we were already packaging software in Debian packages, the aim of
dh-virtualenv was to make transition to virtualenv based installations as
smooth as possible.</p>
<p>
This talk covers how you can use dh-virtualenv to help you deploy your
software to production, where you are already running a Debian-based system,
such as Ubuntu, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of the approach
over other existing and popular techniques. We will discuss the deploying as a
problem in general, look into building a dh-vritualenv-backed package, and in
the end, look into how dh-virtualenv was actually made.</p>
<p>
Goal is that after this presentation you know how to make your Debian/Ubuntu
deployments easier!</p>

    <h3><a href="#talks-python-fit" class="pagelink">
        Elena Oat - Python Is Keeping Me Fit
    </a></h3>
<p>
The ultimate goal of this talk is to inspire people to use Python to achieve their fitness goals. Or to just get to know a little bit more about their own body. 
</p><p>
Some libraries and their use will be presented, that help in exploring our own body (e.g., Fitbit's python-fitbit). Additionally, I may touch on the Intel Galileo/(other boards) that help in this matter. 
</p><p>
The talk is inspired partly by the "Bodily Play" workshop that I participated in this summer with the folks that came from Melbourne's "Exertion Games Lab". 
</p>
<p>
<b>About the author:</b> I am currently pursuing my Master's degree at Aalto University in Computer Science. 
I consider that women are equally able to do well in this field, that's why I founded Helsinki PyLadies that aims to support women in technology. </p>
