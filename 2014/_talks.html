    <h3><a href="#talks-practical-parallelism" class="pagelink">
        Michael Cetrulo - Practical Parallelism and Concurrency in Python -
        from Threads to AsyncIO

<p>
We'll be exploring the different mechanisms and libraries in the Python
ecosystem for concurrent and/or parallel systems while comparing benchmarks
and discussing the pros and cons of each approach.
</p>

    <h3><a href="#talks-enough-ml" class="pagelink">
        Ned Jackson Lovely - Enough Machine Learning to Make Hacker News
        Readable Again
    </a></h3>
<p>
It's inevitable that online communities will change, and that we'll remember
the community with a fondness that likely doesn't accurately reflect the
former reality. We'll explore how we can take a set of articles from an online
community and winnow out the stuff we feel is unworthy. We'll explore some of
the machine learning tools that are just a "pip install" away, such as
scikit-learn and nltk.

</p><p>
<b>About the author:</b> Ned Jackson Lovely is a full-stack Python engineer from
Boston, MA. He is a principal engineer at Spotify is Somerville, MA, where he
helps invent the future of music. At various points in his life he has been a
freelance software consultant, a high school science teacher, and a product
manager. His coolest job was getting paid to teach physics and go on roller
coasters at Walt Disney World.

    <h3><a href="#talks-rope-traad" class="pagelink">
        Austin Bingham - Python Refactoring with Rope and Traad
    </a></h3>
<p>
Python is a modern, dynamic language which is growing in popularity, but tool
support for it is sometime lacking or only available in specific environments.
For refactoring and other common IDE functions, however, the powerful
open-source rope library provides a set of tools which are designed to be
integrated into almost any programming environment. Rope supports most common
refactorings, such as renaming and method extraction, but also more
Python-specific refactorings, such as import organization. Rope’s underlying
code analysis engine also allows it to do things like locating method
definitions and generating auto-completion suggestions.
</p>
<p>
While rope is designed to be used from many environments, it’s not always easy
or ideal to integrate rope directly into other programs. Traad  (Norwegian for
“thread”) is another open-source project that addresses this problem by
wrapping rope into a simple client-server model so that client programs (IDEs,
editors, etc.) can perform refactorings without needing to embed rope
directly. This simplifies dependencies, makes clients more robust in the face
of errors, eases traad client development, and even allows clients to do
things like switch between Python 2 and 3 refactoring in the same session.
</p><p>
In this session we’ll look at how rope operates, and we’ll see how traad wraps
it to provide an easier integration interface. The audience will get enough
information to start using rope themselves, either directly or via traad, and
they’ll see how to use traad for integrating rope into their own environments.
More generally, we’ll look at why client-server refactoring tools might be
preferable to the more standard approach of direct embedding.

    <h3><a href="#talks-extending-python" class="pagelink">
        Francisco Fernández - Extending Python, What Is the Best
        Option for Me?
    </a></h3>
<p>
Python is a great language, but there are occasions where we need access to
low level operations or connect with some database driver written in C. With
the FFI(Foreign function interface) we can connect Python with other languages
like C, C++ and even the new Rust. There are some alternatives to achieve this
goal, Native Extensions, Ctypes and CFFI. I'll compare this three ways of
extending Python.
</p>
<p>
    <b>About the author:</b> Francisco Fernandez works as a software engineer at
    biicode in Madrid. He uses Python as his main programming language but he
    also program in other languages like Scala, Go, Clojure... His main
    interests are distributed systems, functional programming and graph
    databases.

    <h3><a href="#talks-iterators-generators" class="pagelink">
        Andrew Dalke - Iterators, Generators, and Coroutines
    </a></h3>
<p>
Python 2 introduced the iterator protocol, which has since become an essential
language concept. Generators - functions with a yield - make it much easier to
write an iterator. What's less commonly known is that generators have evolved
to be usable co-routines. These are the basis for the new asyncio module in
Python 3.3, though I won't talk about asyncio.
</p><p>
My presentation will structure the concepts around file I/O. I'll develop
various iterators to read records from a file, and then show how to 'reverse'
a generator to make a coroutine to write records to a file.
</p>
<p>
<b>About the author:</b> I've been using Python full-time since the 1990s. I
primarily work in computational chemistry and related fields. I make my living
as a consultant doing custom software development, software sales, and Python
training for computational chemists.

I co-founded the Biopython project, and co-founded the Gothenburg Python
User's Group (GothPy). I am also a member of the PSF.

    <h3><a href="#talks-plotting-matplotlib" class="pagelink">
        Jouni Seppänen - Plotting with Matplotlib
    </a></h3>
<p>
Matplotlib is the most popular plotting library for Python, but getting
started may be daunting for non-experts, especially if you want to format your
plots differently from the default. I will show by example how to create plots
and figure out from the Python prompt how to change the various details.
</p>
<p>
<b>About the author:</b> I'm a software developer at ZenRobotics, with a doctorate in
Computer and Information Science. I have contributed code to matplotlib: my
main contribution is the pdf backend.

    <h3><a href="#talks-democratization" class="pagelink">
        Espartaco Palma - Democratization of Open Data with Python & Open
        Source
    </a></h3>
<p>
Since the beginning of 2000s, Eric von Hippel has presented Models on how Paradigm Shift from Producer Innovation to User and Open Collaborative Innovation, this can be true not only on products, also in how the users can produce innovation on service like the OpenData & Open Government, don't need the main publisher, researcher or Government provide all the work. Push more innovation around this new services.
</p><p>
Nowadays, everybody can improve the data available, curate, create, publish and provide more value on public & open data. Learn a framework like Flask is more accessible than ever, host & publish REST services for free, host the code of project for free also. It's democratizing all the way. All can be done with Python.
</p><p>
In this presentation I'll demonstrate how can use GitHub to publish a data sets (and proper updates) and the code of the Python REST API with no more than 100 lines of code which can be deployed on local installation, plus, with few commands,  deploy on a service with a free tier like OpenShift for a worldwide audience.

        Dmitri Vakhrushev - Pyramid Traversal as the Right Way to Handling URLs
    </a></h3>
<p>
What is Traversal in comparison with traditional regular expression based method of handling URLs in web application? What its benefits? How does it affect application architecture? What kind of problems does it solve? Answers to the questions above and little bit of Pyramid evangelism are in the my talk.
</p>
<p
<b>About the author:</b> I currently work at Thumbtack Technology as a software architect. My primary specialization is web developing, and most favorite tool is Pyramid web framework.

    <h3><a href="#talks-python-fit" class="pagelink">
        Elena Oat - Python Is Keeping Me Fit
    </a></h3>
<p>
The ultimate goal of this talk is to inspire people to use Python to achieve their fitness goals. Or to just get to know a little bit more about their own body. 
</p><p>
Some libraries and their use will be presented, that help in exploring our own body (e.g., Fitbit's python-fitbit). Additionally, I may touch on the Intel Galileo/(other boards) that help in this matter. 
</p><p>
The talk is inspired partly by the "Bodily Play" workshop that I participated in this summer with the folks that came from Melbourne's "Exertion Games Lab". 
</p>
<p>
<b>About the author:</b> I am currently pursuing my Master's degree at Aalto University in Computer Science. 
I consider that women are equally able to do well in this field, that's why I founded Helsinki PyLadies that aims to support women in technology. </p>
