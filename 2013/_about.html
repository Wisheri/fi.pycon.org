<h3><span class="label label-success">Dinner for normal attendees too!</span></h3>
<p>
After the registration deadline closed we counted heads and decided we can afford to offer
dinner for people with normal tickets as well. We'll email more information
after we have final confirmations from the restaurant
</p>
<p>
The dinner is at <a

<h3><span class="label label-info">Late registration possible</span></h3>
<p>
The deadline came and went but we still have space. You can register as a late
bird at a reduced rate. We can't offer lunch or dinner because those have to
be confirmed but we'd love to have you come anyway.
</p>
<p>The late registration is open until the day before the conf but obviously we
might not have name tags etc. if you sign up at the very last minute.</p>
