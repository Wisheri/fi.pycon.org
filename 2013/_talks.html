        Lynn Root - Open Source Your Education [keynote1]
    </a></h3>
<p>
Many want to learn to code, and many choose Python as a first language. If the influx of interest in learning how to code is any indication: software engineering as a career is having its 15 minutes of fame. But in the context of history, software engineering is merely just going through its industrial phase compared to other engineering fields. With revolutionary pace of software development, how best should we teach and learn its principles? This talk looks at how we currently learn how to code, and prescribes how we should learn how to code.

    <h3><a href="#talks-python-numba" class="pagelink">
    Saul Diez-Guerra - My First Numba
    </a></h3>
    <p>
What is numba, why is it different to other alternatives and why would you
want to use it. Basic tutorial, modeling some simple interview question-like
problems, optimizing using numba and analyzing performance from the
perspective of a first-time user.

One of the usual pain points (justified or not) that people like to complain
about Python is speed. Numba is a great, little-known way to speed your code
up while still writing simple python with no special syntax.

    <h3><a href="#talks-python-samba-bindings" class="pagelink">
    Alexander Bokovoy - Python bindings to Samba 4
    </a></h3>
    <p>
Samba 4 implements free software replacement for Active Directory domain controller. To achieve that, it implements many of Active Directory-specific networking protocols using code generation techniques which account to about 40% of whole Samba source code. Samba 4 provides autogenerated Python bindings.

The talk is going to reflect on automatic generation of Python bindings for network protocols and their usefulness. I also plan to touch on potential issues supporting both Python 2.7 and Python 3 from large C-based Python modules' perspective.

Practical examples of using Samba 4 Python bindings based on our experience from FreeIPA project will be provided.Samba 4 implements free software replacement for Active Directory domain controller.

    <h3><a href="#talks-python-debugging-techniques" class="pagelink">
    Tuomas Suutari - Python Debugging Techniques    
</a></h3>
    <p>Even though Python allows many ways to easily debug and profile your code, it is not uncommon to see people overusing simple print statements for this. The presentation will provide an overview of the most common basic debugging techniques that every Python programmer should know. Additionally, for debugging speed or memory problems, couple profilers are presented.

Outline:<ul>
<li>Basic techniques (print statements, logging)</li>
<li>Debuggers (pdb, winpdb/rpdb2)</li>
<li>Profiling (cProfile, guppy, ...)</li></ul> </p>

    Niklas Närhinen - The Bugfix Confirmation Loop - Gitbot & friends
    </a></h3>
    <p>
    You're fixing an issue - probably something that cannot even unit tested. How do you get confirmation that your fix actually works for the one with the original issue? We have a tested workflow that will make your life so much easier. It contains automated deployments from pull requests, multi branch deployments and project dependencies.

    <h3><a href="#talks-pyladies" class="pagelink">
        Elena Oat and Tuikku Anttila - Why PyLadies?    
</a></h3>
    <p>
    The goal of the talk is to give an idea of what is PyLadies community and why we (2 event organizers) have created one in Finland. One of the main outlines of the talk is to explain the purpose of the group, to tell what we have been doing until now, and that our membership is not limited by gender - PyLadies is about sharing ideas on software development in Python in a comfortable environment among ladies and (!) gentlemen. 

Besides this, we will talk about why we chose Python as our language of preference and how the PyLadies meetups help up stay up-to-date and motivated.

    <h3><a href="#talks-functional-acrobatics" class="pagelink">
    Pyry Jahkola - Functional Acrobatics in Python    
</a></h3>
    <p>
Python ♥ FP. Let's add to Python a few highly composable tools from the functional programming world, and see how Python can be used as a space age calculator for solving numerous little engineering problems – while thinking.
