            <p>Python Finland is the local user group in Finland and Scandinavia area. Python Finland has about hundred active members. Our organization was founded in 2011 in order to promote Python knowledge, usage and education in Finland.

PyCon Finland is a part of the international PyCon conference program.</p>
          
            <p>We are contacting you as your organization is using and promoting Python technology and therefore you might be interested in sponsoring the PyCon Finland event.
